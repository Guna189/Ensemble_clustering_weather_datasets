Abstract

Ensemble Learning is a popular Machine Learning technique that combines 
multiple models to achieve better accuracy and generalization than individual 
models. This project aims to investigate the use of Ensemble Learning to 
improve the accuracy of Cluster Analysis. Traditional cluster algorithms may 
have limitations when dealing with datasets that have multiple attributes, some 
of which may not be related. By applying Ensemble Learning techniques, we hope 
to improve the clustering accuracy and identify hidden patterns in the data.
The proposed project involves selecting a dataset that has 8 or more attributes, 
with related and non-related attributes, and has been shown to have low 
accuracy with traditional clustering algorithms. We will then apply Ensemble 
Learning methods to the dataset to improve the clustering accuracy. To validate 
our model, we will compare the results with those obtained from various 
datasets and traditional clustering algorithms.
The role of Ensemble Learning in cluster analysis has significant importance in 
data analysis. It can improve the accuracy of clustering algorithms and identify 
hidden patterns in the data that may not be visible with traditional methods. 
Therefore, the success of our project can have a significant impact on improving 
the accuracy of clustering analysis in real-world applications.

Introduction

Cluster analysis is a widely used data exploration technique that groups similar 
data points together based on their similarities. It plays a crucial role in pattern 
recognition, data mining, and information retrieval. However, traditional 
clustering algorithms may face challenges when dealing with datasets that contain 
multiple attributes, some of which might not be directly related to the clusters. 
This can lead to less accurate clustering results and obscure meaningful patterns 
present in the data.
Ensemble Learning offers a solution to these challenges by combining multiple 
clustering algorithms to create a stronger and more robust model. The 
ensemble model can effectively mitigate the weaknesses of individual algorithms 
and improve overall clustering accuracy. By applying Ensemble Learning to 
cluster analysis, we aim to achieve better insights and identify hidden structures 
within the data.
Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
• Investigate the use of Ensemble Learning techniques for improving 
clustering accuracy in datasets with diverse attributes.
• Select a suitable dataset with 8 or more attributes, including both related 
and non-related attributes.
• Apply various Ensemble Learning methods to the dataset and compare 
their performance.
• Validate the accuracy improvement of the ensemble model against 
traditional clustering algorithms.
• Identify hidden patterns and meaningful clusters within the data using the 
ensemble approach.

Results
Weather History Dataset
Weather Prediction Dataset

Conclusion

• The voting technique of ensembling with the Mean Shift and Birch 
clustering algorithm yielded a higher silhouette score and lower DaviesBouldin score in the analysis of the Weather Prediction dataset and 
Weather History dataset.
• The lower Davies-Bouldin score highlights distinct and meaningful 
clusters with minimal overlap and high inter-cluster similarity, supporting 
the identification of homogeneous groups within the dataset.
• The higher silhouette score indicates well-separated and closely-knit 
data points within each cluster, showcasing the successful capture of 
inherent structures and patterns in the weather data.
• The effectiveness of the ensembling approach with the Mean Shift and 
Birch clustering algorithm demonstrates its value in improving clustering 
accuracy and robustness.
• Overall, these insights enhance decision-making, data exploration, and 
understanding of the underlying structures in the Weather datasets.
